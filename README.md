# My-To-Do-List


# 📝 Web-Based To-Do List Application
To-Do List is a basic, functional web-based To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks.

This simple and functional **To-Do List web application** is built using:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for client-side interactivity
- **PHP** for server-side data persistence (file-based, no database)

📌 The goal of this project was to demonstrate full-stack web development fundamentals using a **file-based backend**, allowing tasks to be saved and persisted across page refreshes.

## 💡 Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as **completed** or **pending**
- Visually differentiate completed tasks (line-through)
- Tasks are saved in a file (`tasks.json`) using PHP
- Persistent storage (tasks don’t disappear on refresh)
