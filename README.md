# My-To-Do-List
My To-Do List is a basic, functional web-based To-Do List application that allows users to manage their tasks.

# 📝 Web-Based To-Do List Application

This is a simple, functional **To-Do List web application** built using:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for client-side interactivity
- **PHP** for server-side data persistence (file-based, no database)

📌 The goal of this project was to demonstrate full-stack web development fundamentals using a **file-based backend**, allowing tasks to be saved and persisted across page refreshes.
